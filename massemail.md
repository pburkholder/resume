Hi %friend%

I hope all is well.

As you may know, I've spent most of the last two years with Chef Software,
working with major Chef customers on successful infrastructure automation rollouts and
the adoption of DevOps tools and practices.

I am on the hunt for new opportunities in DevOps implementation and
leadership, which could span infrastructure automation,
continuous delivery, cloud migration, and compliance/security. I'm reaching out to you to ask for
your help with any leads or contacts. As I was let go as part of a recent corporate
re-organizaion, I'd like to secure a new position by mid-June.

If you know of any job opportunities or leads that you might be able to share
with me, please send them my way. Below is a summary of my recent positions,
sample job titles, some parameters that are guiding my job search, and links
to more detailed backgound material.

Thanks in advance for your help! I hope you are doing well and hope to
catch up with you personally soon.

Cheers,

Peter
