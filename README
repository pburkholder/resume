Installing TeX from source is weird and gross, requires a lot of patches,
and only builds 32-bit (and thus can't use Homebrew deps on Snow Leopard.)

We recommend using a MacTeX distribution: http://www.tug.org/mactex/

## 2016 notes:

Install basicTex from https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html

Set path and install LaTex make and Ghostscript:

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2015basic/bin/x86_64-darwin
    brew install homebrew/tex/latex-mk
    brew install ghostscript

Then:

    make
