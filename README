Peter Burkholder's resumé

Resumé compiled from LaTeX: +12 points: ![How a programmer reads a resume](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/resume_comic.png)

Mac install and build, with BasicTex


    brew cask install basictex
    brew install ghostscript
    export PATH=$PATH:/Library/TeX/texbin
    sudo tlmgr update --self
    sudo tlmgr install latexmk

Then:

    make

Caveats:

There may be features missing using
[BasicTex](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html), but, 
MacTeX (3.2 Gb, ugh). May be worth trying  
Dockerized LaTeX as suggested at https://github.com/Arxisos/LaTex-Workshop-Docker
