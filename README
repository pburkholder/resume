Mac install and build, with MacTeX (3.2 Gb, ugh). This may also work with basicTex. Or, next time, try a 
Dockerized LaTeX as suggested at https://github.com/Arxisos/LaTex-Workshop-Docker

    brew cask install mactex
    brew install ghostscript
    export PATH=$PATH:/Library/TeX/texbin
    sudo tlmgr update --self
    sudo tlmgr install latexmk

Then:

    make
